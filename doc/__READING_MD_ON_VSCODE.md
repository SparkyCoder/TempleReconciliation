# Reading MD Files on Visual Studio Code

## Overview

Markdown files are very useful for docuementation for the following reasons:

- Small File Size
- Simple to Read
- Wide Usage
- Version Control

## Viewing on Visual Studio Code

When viewing these .md files, through Visual Studio Code, you will be viewing the file in its raw Markdown Source Code.<br>
While this is readable, it is restricted based on restricted and unformatted the file looks (especially for images and tables).<br>

To Revolve this, we want to view the .md file in preview mode so we can see the formated verison of the file:

- Through Explorer/Folder
  - Right Click on the .md file and select "Open Preview"
- Through Shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+V)
  - If shortcuts are not changed, then when you are on the .md file, Press Ctrl+Shift+V(iew)
